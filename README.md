Command for running the project: <python3 blabla>

# Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- sklearn

# Dataset 
Dataset is downloadable at https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz
Then, you obtain a .npz file containing 4 files:
  - x_test.npy
  - x_train.npy
  - y_test.npy
  - y_train.npy
  
 x_train.npy contains 60,000 images (28x28) gathered in the same file. 
 To save the dataset as a real set of pictures, you need to proceed like the following:
\>\>\> import numpy as np
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> import seaborn as sns
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> from tensorflow import keras
>>> from sklean.metrics import f1_score, roc_auc_score, log_loss
>>> 
>>> #If you've download mnist.npz at https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/mnist.npz do this
>>> (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data('path/to/minis.npz')
>>> 
>>> #If you've not download mnist.npz, it will be automatically downloaded by doing this
>>> (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
>>> 
>>> i = 1
>>> for im in X_train:
...     plt.imsave('Path/to/save/dataset/' + str(i) + '.jpg', im, format = 'jpg') 
...     i += 1
>>> 
>>> #Now, you can go to 'Path/to/save/dataset/' to see the 60,000 pictures of hand written numbers
